hi there! you must be the new player.
i'm pipi! your new virtual pet!
you need to take care of me, just like a real pet!
i need to be fed, i need to be cleaned, and...
i need money!
a lot of it, in fact.
so it would be great if you can get me money before two weeks!
time is money, y'know!
huh? what if you can't get it done by then?
oh i don't know... maybe... i take all your data?
ahaha! i'm not sure yet!
but are you gonna risk it...?

have you seen the post i made?
i'm a pretty big deal on social media. i guess it's a testament to my cuteness!!
i'm sure a lot of your coworkers follow me, too.
so you wouldn't want any of them to see my posts that show you in a bad light, right?
just so you know, i post a lot. both the good and the bad.
and if your boss finds out your abusing poor, little, helpless pipi...
your salary just might be at risk!!! don't let that happen, yeah?

hey! how's it going?
i just wanted to say, thanks for all that money you've been giving me!
i was able to get that prada bag i've been eyeing for a while!
and afterwards i got food with some friends at a 3 star michelin restaurant!
what? of course i paid the whole bill! what kind of sicko would i be if i didn't treat my friends?
anyway, time's ticking and i'm definitely gonna need a bit more money after all that. thanks!

time's up, pal! do you have my money?
oh.. you don't? well, that's really unfortunate.
and i mean really, really, unfortunate.
because that means it's time to take all of your data!
at least that'll be able to make me some money, right?
good luck with everything!!

oh, do you like my ride? it's all thanks to you!
i'll keep my promise and leave you alone.

anyway, thanks for everything! bye bye!!
