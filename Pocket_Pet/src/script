hi there! you must be the new player.
i'm pipi! your new virtual pet!
you need to take care of me, just like a real pet!
i need to be fed, i need to be cleaned, and...
i need money!
a lot of it, in fact.
so it would be great if you can get me money before two weeks!
time is money, y'know!
huh? what if you can't get it done by then?
oh i don't know... maybe... i take all your data?
ahaha! i'm not sure yet!
but are you gonna risk it...?

have you seen the post i made?
i'm a pretty big deal on social media. i guess it's a testament to my cuteness!!
i'm sure a lot of your coworkers follow me, too.
so you wouldn't want any of them to see my posts that show you in a bad light, right?
just so you know, i post a lot. both the good and the bad.
and if your boss finds out your abusing poor, little, helpless pipi...
your salary just might be at risk!!! don't let that happen, yeah?

heyyyyyyy.. how have you been?
don't care, didn't ask, but i've been great.
thanks for all that money you've been giving me!
i was able to get that prada bag i've been eyeing for a while
after i got food with some friends at a 3 star michelin restaurant!
of course i paid! what kind of sicko would i be if i didn't pay for my friends
any who, time is ticking and i think i'm gonna need a bit more money. thanks!

so, time's up pal! do you have my money?
oh.. you don't? well, that's really unfortunate.
and i mean really, really, unfortunate.
cause that means it's time to take all of your data!
don't tell me you forgot what i said in the beginning when we met?
